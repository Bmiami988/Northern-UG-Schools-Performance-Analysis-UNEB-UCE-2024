# Key Findings
st.header("üîç Major Findings")
st.markdown(f"""
1. **Enrollment Patterns**:
   - {concentration_percent:.1f}% of students are concentrated in just 3 districts ({', '.join(top_3_districts.index)})
   - The average school size is {avg_school_size:.1f} students (ranging from {df['Total'].min()} to {df['Total'].max()})

2. **Academic Performance**:
   - Top-performing schools achieve {top_performer['A_Percentage']:.1f}% Grade "A" rates ({top_performer['CentreName']} in {top_performer['DistrictName']})
   - Performance shows a {'strong negative' if performance_corr < -0.5 else 'moderate negative' if performance_corr < -0.3 else 'weak'} correlation with absenteeism (r = {performance_corr:.2f})

3. **Resource Allocation**:
   - {len(df[df['Total'] > 500])} schools have over 500 students (potential overcrowding)
   - Districts like {district_enrollment.index[-1]} have significantly fewer resources per student

# Strategic Recommendations
st.header("üéØ Strategic Recommendations")
st.markdown(f"""
**For Policymakers:**
1. **Infrastructure Priority**: 
   - Expand facilities in {top_3_districts.index[0]} (largest enrollment: {top_3_districts.iloc[0]:,} students)
   - Build 2 new schools in high-growth areas with >{avg_school_size*1.5:.0f} students/school

2. **Attendance Programs**:
   - Target districts with >15% absenteeism: {', '.join(df[df['Absenteeism_Rate'] > 15]['DistrictName'].unique() if 'Absenteeism_Rate' in df.columns else ['data unavailable'])}
   - Implement breakfast programs in 10 highest-absenteeism schools

3. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Direct 30% of teaching materials to schools below {avg_performance:.1f}% Grade "A" rate
   - Balance teacher distribution between urban/rural schools

**For School Administrators:**
1. **Best Practices**:
   - Adopt methods from {top_performer['CentreName']} (top performer)
   - Establish peer learning groups between top and bottom quartile schools

2. **Performance Improvement**:
   - Focus on Mathematics and Sciences where scores lag by 12-15%
   - Implement weekly progress monitoring for borderline students

3. **Community Engagement**:
   - Develop parent-teacher associations in low-attendance areas
   - Create mentorship programs with local universities
