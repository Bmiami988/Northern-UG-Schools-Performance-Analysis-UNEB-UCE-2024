1. **Attendance-Performance Relationship**: 
   - Correlation coefficient: {correlation:.2f}
   - {'Strong negative' if correlation < -0.5 else 'Moderate negative' if correlation < -0.3 else 'Weak negative' if correlation < 0 else 'No significant'} correlation between absenteeism and performance

2. **Performance Distribution**:
   - Average Grade "A" rate: {avg_performance:.1f}% Â± {performance_std:.1f}%
   - Range: {performance_range:.1f}% between highest and lowest performing schools

3. **District Variations**:
   - Highest performing district: {top_district} ({district_performance['mean'].iloc[0]:.1f}%)
   - Lowest performing district: {bottom_district} ({district_performance['mean'].iloc[-1]:.1f}%)
   - Difference: {district_diff:.1f} percentage points

# Practical Recommendations
st.header("ðŸŽ¯ Actionable Recommendations")
st.markdown(f"""
1. **For High-Performing Schools** ({top_district} district):
   - Document and share teaching methodologies from {top_schools.iloc[0]['CentreName']} (top performer at {top_schools.iloc[0]['A_Percentage']:.1f}%)
   - Establish peer learning programs with neighboring schools

2. **For Low-Performing Schools** ({bottom_district} district):
   - Implement targeted teacher training focusing on core subjects
   - Address absenteeism in schools showing >20% absentee rate
   - Pair with mentor schools from {top_district}

3. **Attendance Improvement**:
   - Prioritize schools where absenteeism >15% and performance <{avg_performance:.1f}%
   - Investigate transportation barriers in rural schools with high absenteeism

4. **Resource Allocation**:
   - Direct additional teaching materials to schools below {avg_performance - performance_std:.1f}% Grade "A" rate
   - Consider redistributing teaching staff to balance experience levels
